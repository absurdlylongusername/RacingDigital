# RACING DIGITAL TECHNICAL TEST - DAVID ASUNMO

Plan: show winners table, can select race and make notes

Then dropdown to select a horse, and it will show leaderboard of best jockey for that horse

have parameters you can change


Ideal solution

Have jockey leaderboard with default rankings, have table with all race winners (or just all races), and then can select a race to see details of the race and also makes notes on the race


Jockey leaderboard table ranking parameters can be changed.

Ranking has points mechanism: higher placing in race gets more points.
But also taking into account:
  points for being close to 1st place
  Points for near win
  points per place (1st = 3, 2nd = 2, 3rd = 1) can customized
  Distance of the race also taken into account, assuming that jockeys may have more skill based on the length of the race.
   so races have distance buckets (e.g. 1000-1700, 1700-2200, 2200+), and can see which jockey is best for each distance (assuming enough data)
  percentile finish (where place with respect to how many racers in the race)
